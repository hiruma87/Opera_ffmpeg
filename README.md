### Fix Opera Linux libffmpeg & WidevineCdm

* Fixes Opera html5 media content including DRM-protected one.
* This script must be executed all times opera fails on showing html5 media content.
* On Debian-based, RedHat-based and Arch-based distributions it could be started automatically after Opera each update or reinstall.
* Works only with native versions of Opera. Won't work with flatpak/snap releses.
* May not work with opera-beta and opera-develper.
